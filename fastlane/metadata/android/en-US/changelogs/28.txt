* Fix: Get activities for Android version 11+ (API version 30+)
* Feature: Settings UI improvement (thanks to @mrhcjones)
* Feature: Allow enhanced Twitter/X requests for feeds as an option in Settings/General/Feed subsection,
  although those requests have lower rate limits (50 per 15 min vs 190 per 15 min).
